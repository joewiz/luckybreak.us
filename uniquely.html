        <p>If you are looking for a way to add something special to your celebration, this just
            might be your Lucky Break.</p>
        <p>Now you can experience the blending of traditional American bluegrass music with Shabbat
            Z’mirot during your Jewish-themed events. Lucky Break is a roots-oriented bluegrass band
            that brings a traditional and expressive voice to the genre while providing a fresh
            approach to the songs of the Sabbath. Once you hear the rockabilly influence on “Shalom
            Aleichem” and the Celtic flavor of “Tzur Mishelo” you’ll never think of Shabbat Z’mirot
            the same way again.</p>
        <p>Lead singer Jerry Wicentowski is acknowledged as one of the great voices in bluegrass and
            is well-known among bluegrass purists. His secular <a href="cd.html">solo CD</a> was
            pronounced one of 1998’s best traditional bluegrass recordings by Dave Freeman of County
            Sales. With this background, it is natural that Jerry expresses his Jewish spirituality
            through this American musical form. (Listen to Tablet Magazine reporter’s Jon Kalish <a
                href="http://www.tabletmag.com/podcasts/21468/blessed-bluegrass/">interview with
                Jerry</a>.) </p>
        <p>The other band members have extensive experience as well, allowing them to successfully
            capture and blend the Appalachian and Jewish spiritual roots of the music. Marc
            Edelstein (string bass) and Drew Carson (mandolin) are long-time mainstays of the
            Chicago bluegrass scene and former members of Special Consensus, another superior
            Midwestern bluegrass band. Tom Boyd, (banjo, dobro) who performed and recorded with the
            great traditional singer and bandleader Larry Sparks, completes the quartet.</p>
        <p>Lucky Break has achieved the acclaim of audiences in the Midwest. The band is a unique
            entertainment option that brings a special flair to your personal, corporate, or
            organization’s celebrations and fundraisers.</p>
