                        <h4><em>Music is a Language of Many Dialects <br /> Lucky Break Speaks Just
                                One â€” Traditional Bluegrass</em>
                        </h4>
                        <p>Before mass culture made us all the same from suburb to shining suburb,
                            our dialect told people where we came from. Lucky Break's home is in the
                            music of the Appalachian hills-- in sad ballads of lost loves and hard
                            times, in breakneck fiddle tunes that couild make the dead tap their
                            feet, and in sweet songs of redeeming love, heavenly and otherwise. the
                            oldest songs have traveled well for hundreds of years, becoming a
                            tradition that transcends place and time. Bluegrass music is no longer
                            regional. But the source remains the same and will never change.</p>
                        <p>It's the distilled essence of the life of the common folk filtered
                            through three chords and poured from the heart that makes Lucky Break's
                            music what it is. The pure vocals, intricate harmonies, and instrumental
                            virtuousity are all here too, but that's the easy part. It's the feeling
                            that separates high lonesome from high tech.</p>
                        <p>So if your recent musical listening has involved too much slick
                            production and not enough broken heart, sample some of our songs. It
                            might be the Lucky Break you've been waiting for.</p>
