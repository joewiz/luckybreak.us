Lucky Break is a roots-oriented bluegrass band that brings a traditional and expressive voice to the genre while providing a fresh approach to the songs of the Sabbath. Once you hear the rockabilly influence on “Shalom Aleichem” and the Celtic flavor of “Tzur Mishelo” you’ll never think of Shabbat Z’mirot the same way again.</p><p>Lead singer Jerry Wicentowski is acknowledged as one of the great voices in bluegrass and is well-known among bluegrass purists. His secular <a href="cd.html">solo CD</a> was pronounced one of 1998’s best traditional bluegrass recordings by Dave Freeman of County Sales. With this background, it is natural that Jerry expresses his Jewish spirituality through this American musical form. (Listen to Tablet Magazine reporter's Jon Kalish <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/podcasts/21468/blessed-bluegrass/">interview with Jerry</a>.) </p><p>The other band members have extensive experience as well, allowing them to successfully capture and blend the Appalachian and Jewish spiritual roots of the music. Marc Edelstein (string bass) and Drew Carson (mandolin) are long-time mainstays of the Chicago bluegrass scene and former members of Special Consensus, another superior Midwestern bluegrass band. Tom Boyd, (banjo, dobro) who performed and recorded with the great traditional singer and bandleader Larry Sparks, completes the quartet.</p><p>Lucky Break has achieved the acclaim of audiences in the Midwest. The band is a unique entertainment option that brings a special flair to your personal, corporate, or organization’s celebrations and fundraisers.</p></td><!--<td valign="top" width="210">                        <table>                            <tbody>                            	<h3>                            		<em>upcoming shows</em>                            	</h3>                            	<ul>                            		<li>Thu., Jan. 20, 2011 <br/> 7:30 P.M.<br/> MoFiddles<br/> 4260 Town Center Way<br/> Livingston, NJ</li>                            		<li>Sat., Jan. 22, 2011 <br/> 8:45 P.M.<br/> Jewish Music Cafe<br/> 401 9th St.<br/> Brooklyn, NY</li>                            		<li>Sun., Jan. 23, 2011 <br/> 7:00 P.M.<br/> Davar Institute<br/> 1500 Sussex Rd.<br/> Teaneck, NJ</li>                            	</ul>                            </tbody>                      	</table>                    </td>--></tr></tbody></table></center></body></html>
