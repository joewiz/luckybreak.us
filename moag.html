            <h2>The Debut of Jerry Wicentowski<br /> By Rod Moag</h2>
        </center>
        <blockquote>
            <p>One of several things that makes this album stand out is the fact that all the big
                names on it are sidemen, while the featured vocalist is a relative unknown, unknown
                unless you were one of a small circle of teenagers in New York City in the 60's who
                like <b>Jody Stecher</b>, <b>Andy Statman</b>, and <b>Tony Trischka</b> who got
                turned on to bluegrass, studied it seriously, and honed their skills to an awesome
                level. Unlike those just named, <b>Jerry Wicentowski</b> did not go on to a full
                time career in music, opting instead to pursue higher studies in his Jewish faith in
                both Israel and the U.S., for a number of years, then becoming a financial advisor
                in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, just 90 miles from the University of Wisconsin in Madison
                where he and I met and performed together in a group called The Bluegrass Hoppers in
                the late 1960s.</p>
            <p>Even if you know nothing about Jerry's background, your attention will be commanded
                by his outstanding vocal performances on this, his first solo album. His high clear
                voice carries on the tradition of the pioneers in bluegrass, especially <b>Bill
                    Monroe</b> and <b>Red Alan</b>, but he is far from a pale immitation or carbon
                copy of those early greats. Jerry's performances here have uniqueness, depth of
                feeling, and most important, respect and reverence for the music.</p>
            <p>The twelve tracks on the album represent a skillful blending of classics and
                thoughtfully chosen new material. Traditional numbers (five in all) include "Little
                Maggie," "Live and Let Live," and "Whose Shoulder Will You Cry On" -- a <b>Kity
                    Wells</b> hit from the 50's made into a bluegrass chestnut by <b>Red Alan</b>.
                The remaining two are traditional songs, heard in most available recordings in
                oldtimey style. Jerry brings two more classic pieces solidly into the bluegrass
                catalog with excellent versions of "The Miner's Child" and "Mary of the Wild Moor."
                Yes, the Bailey Brothers recorded "Mary of the Wild Moor," but try and find a copy
                of it.</p>
            <p>The seven newer songs in this project also come from outside the bluegrass
                mainstream, though three of the writers will be familiar. The Iris deMent, song
                "Sweet is the Melody" may be best known to bluegrass fans. The liner notes
                mistakenly credit <b>Robin and Linda Williams</b>' composition "They All Faded Away"
                to Iris, also (these things happen). Two songs are penned by Hot Rise member <b>Tim
                    O'Brien</b>, who sings tenor on everything but Jerry's three solo tracks. The
                curious thing about O'Brien's work here (as sideman) is that you don't know that
                it's him singing tenor. The unique vocal quality so audible on Tim's solo work and
                his duets with sister Molly is not found here. Instead, he blends seamlessly with
                Jerry's lead vocals in a way that lets the distinctive quality of Jerry's voice show
                through. He is identifyable on one track, but more about that later. One of Tim's
                songs, "Tempest of a Jealous Love," will appear on Vol. 36 of Prime Cuts of
                Bluegrass, with tracks by <b>Allison Kraus</b>, the <b>Butch Baldassari Trio</b>,
                and others.</p>
            <p>The other sidemen are less self-effacing than O'Brien. <b>Byron Berline's</b>
                5-string fiddle is unmistakeable and impeccably tasteful on every track, both leads
                and fills, hard-driving or incredibly sweet as the song requires, his low string
                adding a special touch and feeling. <b>Andy Statman's</b> mandolin playing is
                phenomenal in many places. He has not recorded bluegrass material for a long time
                (he is one of the premier klesmer clarinetists around New York), but you wouldn't
                know it from his playing. He uses those notes way up on the neck better than anyone
                you'll hear with the possible exception of Grisman. Equally arresting is the way he
                uses silence, holding off on starting a line to build tension, only to release it in
                a dazzling cascade of notes, or sometimes riding a single high note for longer than
                you would think anyone should, but it works and adds a distinctiveness to Andy's
                playing that on its own makes the album worth acquiring. <b>Scott Vestal's</b>
                banjo, too, is solid, but perhaps least recognizeable. If there's anything negative
                to report about this album it's that in a couple of places where Statman is doing
                something incredible in a mandolin break, he's too far down in the mix to pick out
                every subtle bit of virtuosity.</p>
            <p>Overall, however, this is by far the best mixed album I've heard in a good while.
                Much of the credit for this goes to co-producer and Bluegrass Boys veteran, <b>Mark
                    Hembree</b>, who also plays bass throughout and contributes tastefully
                understated baratone vocals on several tracks. I understand that Mark could not get
                the mix he wanted with the rock-oriented studio engineer in the Milwaukee studio,
                where all tracks but O'Brien's vocals were recorded. In frustration he took the
                unmixed master to Nashville, and this probably saved the album from being just
                another badly mixed bluegrass album of the 90's. Hembree bucks the current trend of
                keeping the guitar so low in the mix that virtually all you hear are the lead
                instruments and the bass. The only way you know there's a guitar in the band on many
                modern bluegrass recordings (with some notable exceptions) is when it takes a break,
                or by a faint G-run once in a while. Jerry's album takes us back to the classic
                sound of bluegrass where the guitar is well-heard and the bass is neither electric
                nor overpowering. What ever happened to the concept of "blend."</p>
            <p>A couple other things deserve mention to represent this album adequately. The first,
                and perhaps most telling, endorsement of the overall quality of the album is that,
                after hearing it, <b>Dave Freeman</b> decided to distribute the album nationally
                through his <a href="http://www.countysales.com">County Record Sales</a> - a
                remarkable distinction for a private non-label album by an unknown artist.
                Additional notable tracks on the CD are the title cut, Lucky Break (recorded several
                years ago by <b>Roland White</b>) and a fantastic performance of Junior Brown's song
                Venom Wearing Denham. The most unusual number of all is the haunting Conversation in
                the Womb from the pen of Toronto songwriter, <b>Abie Rotenberg</b>. This gripping,
                and somewhat eery, selection adds another minor key song to the bluegrass repertoire
                (it's now a bluegrass song owing to Jerry's sensitive rendition). More notable than
                the minor key, however, is the theme of the piece. Birth is used as a metaphor for
                our journey into the next world, and the thoughts and fears that the two brothers
                express while together in the womb are poignantly conveyed by the alternating voices
                of Jerry and Tim O'Brien - and here's where Tim's voice is recognizeable. I won't
                spoil it by telling you how the song ends - you have to get the album to find
                out.</p>
            <p>I believe this is the most exciting bluegrass album to come out a quite a while, and
                I say that realizing it puts a number of very fine albums in second place. If the
                few weeks of experience are any indication, it only takes hearing one or two cuts to
                convince bluegrass fans and non-bluegrassers alike to obtain their own copy for
                extended listening. The album does tend to reach out and get you hooked. This is not
                the first recording Jerry Wicentowski has made. The Bluegrass Hoppers (mentioned
                above) had a nationally distributed album in the late 60's. Jerry's vocal
                performances on that long out-of-print vinyl are surprisingly similar in quality to
                his new offering.</p>
            <p>This would be an outstanding album even if Jerry were a top nationally known full
                time touring act. For a local part time performer to come up with a project of this
                outstanding quality is truly remarkable. I predict great success for this album,
                including a second pressing very soon. Jerry, I hope you're already working on a
                follow-up album; you're definitely gonna need one. My only reservation is "what can
                you possibly do to top this first effort."</p>
