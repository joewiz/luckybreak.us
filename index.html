        <p>Before mass culture made us all the same from suburb to shining suburb, our
            dialect told people where we came from. Lucky Break’s home is in the music
            of the Appalachian hills – in sad ballads of lost loves and hard times, in
            breakneck fiddle tunes that could make the dead tap their feet, and in
            sweet songs of redeeming love, heavenly and otherwise. The oldest songs have
            traveled well for hundreds of years, becoming a tradition that transcends
            place and time. Bluegrass music is no longer regional. But the source
            remains the same and will never change.</p>
        <p>It’s the distilled essence of the life of the common folk filtered through
            three chords and poured from the heart that makes Lucky Break’s music what
            it is. The pure vocals, intricate harmonies, and instrumental virtuosity
            are all here too, but that’s the easy part. It’s the feeling that separates
            high lonesome from high tech.</p>
        <p>So if your recent musical listening has involved too much slick production
            and not enough broken heart, sample some of our songs. It might be the Lucky
            Break you’ve been waiting for.</p>
