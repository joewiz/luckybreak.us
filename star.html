I met Jerry W. a couple months back when he was in town** (performing at
the Bottom Line with a Statman led ensemble as the opener for the Sam Bush
Band).

He is a truly stunning lead vocalist, with a rich Mac Wiseman-caliber
baritone but the drive and cujones of Jimmy Martin.  In bluegrass today--
ie with more tenor-ish singers like Ricky Skaggs and Del McCoury singing
lead--it is refreshing to hear.

... he's capable of the kind of vocal bear-hug that you get from Doc.

Anyway, check him out if he's ever playing near you.
