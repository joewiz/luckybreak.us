Unlike those just named, <B>JerryWicentowski</B> did not go on to a full time career in music, opting instead topursue higher studies in his Jewish faith in both Israel and the U.S., fora number of years, then becoming a financial advisor in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, just 90 miles from the University of Wisconsin in Madison where he andI met and performed together in a group called The Bluegrass Hoppers in thelate 1960s.<P>Even if you know nothing about Jerry's background, your attention willbe commanded by his outstanding vocal performances on this, his first soloalbum.  His high clear voice carries on the tradition of the pioneers inbluegrass, especially <B>Bill Monroe</B> and <B>Red Alan</B>, but he is far from a paleimmitation or carbon copy of those early greats.  Jerry's performances here have uniqueness, depth of feeling, and most important, respect and reverence for the music.<P>The twelve tracks on the album represent a skillful blending ofclassics and thoughtfully chosen new material.  Traditional numbers (fivein all) include "Little Maggie," "Live and Let Live," and "Whose Shoulder WillYou Cry On" -- a <B>Kity Wells</B> hit from the 50's made into a bluegrass chestnutby <B>Red Alan</B>.  The remaining two are traditional songs, heard in mostavailable recordings in oldtimey style.  Jerry brings two more classicpieces solidly into the bluegrass catalog with excellent versions of "TheMiner's Child" and "Mary of the Wild Moor."  Yes, the Bailey Brothers recorded"Mary of the Wild Moor," but try and find a copy of it.<P>The seven newer songs in this project also come from outside thebluegrass mainstream, though three of the writers will be familiar.  TheIris deMent,  song "Sweet is the Melody" may be best known to bluegrassfans.  The liner notes mistakenly credit <B>Robin and Linda Williams</B>'composition "They All Faded Away" to Iris, also (these things happen).  Twosongs are penned by Hot Rise member <B>Tim O'Brien</B>, who sings tenor oneverything but Jerry's three solo tracks.  The curious thing aboutO'Brien's work here (as sideman) is that you don't know that it's himsinging tenor.  The unique vocal quality so audible on Tim's solo work andhis duets with sister Molly is not found here.  Instead, he blendsseamlessly with Jerry's lead vocals in a way that lets the distinctivequality of Jerry's voice show through.  He is identifyable on one track, but more about that later.  One of Tim's songs, "Tempest of a Jealous Love," will appear on Vol. 36 of Prime Cuts of Bluegrass, with tracks by <B>Allison Kraus</B>, the <B>Butch Baldassari Trio</B>,  and others.<P>The other sidemen are less self-effacing than O'Brien.  <B>Byron Berline's</B>5-string fiddle is unmistakeable and impeccably tasteful on every track,both leads and fills, hard-driving or incredibly sweet as the songrequires, his low string adding a special touch and feeling.  <B>Andy Statman's</B>mandolin playing is phenomenal in many places. He has not recorded bluegrass material for a long time (he is one of the premier klesmer clarinetists around New York), but you wouldn't know it from his playing. He uses those notes way up on the neck better than anyone you'll hear with the possible exception of Grisman.  Equally arresting is the way he uses silence, holdingoff on starting a line to build tension, only to release it in a dazzlingcascade of notes, or sometimes riding a single high note for longer thanyou would think anyone should, but it works and adds a distinctiveness toAndy's playing that on its own makes the album worth acquiring.  <B>ScottVestal's</B> banjo, too, is solid, but perhaps least recognizeable.  If there's anything negative to report about this album it's that in a couple of places where Statman is doing something incredible in a mandolin break, he's too far down in the mix to pick out every subtle bit of virtuosity.<P>Overall, however, this is by far the best mixed album I've heard in agood while.  Much of the credit for this goes to co-producer and BluegrassBoys veteran, <B>Mark Hembree</B>, who also plays bass throughout and contributestastefully understated baratone vocals on several tracks.  I understandthat Mark could not get the mix he wanted with the rock-oriented studioengineer in the Milwaukee studio, where all tracks but O'Brien's vocalswere recorded.  In frustration he took the unmixed master to Nashville, andthis probably saved the album from being just another badly mixed bluegrassalbum of the 90's.  Hembree bucks the current trend of keeping the guitarso low in the mix that virtually all you hear are the lead instruments andthe bass.  The only way you know there's a guitar in the band on manymodern bluegrass recordings (with some notable exceptions) is when it takesa break, or by a faint G-run once in a while.  Jerry's album takes us backto the classic sound of bluegrass where the guitar is well-heard and thebass is neither electric nor overpowering.  What ever happened to theconcept of "blend."<P>A couple other things deserve mention to represent this albumadequately.  The first, and perhaps most telling, endorsement of theoverall quality of the album is that, after hearing it, <B>DaveFreeman</B> decided to distribute the album nationally through his <AHREF="http://www.countysales.com">County Record Sales</A> - a remarkabledistinction for a private non-label album by an unknown artist. Additional notable tracks on the CD are the title cut, Lucky Break(recorded several years ago by <B>Roland White</B>) and a fantastic performanceof Junior Brown's song Venom Wearing Denham.  The most unusual number ofall is the haunting Conversation in the Womb from the pen of Torontosongwriter, <B>Abie Rotenberg</B>.  This gripping, and somewhat eery, selection adds another minor key song to the bluegrass repertoire (it'snow a bluegrass song owing to Jerry's sensitive rendition).  Morenotable than the minor key, however, is the theme of the piece.  Birthis used as a metaphor for our journey into the next world, and thethoughts and fears that the two brothers  express while together in thewomb are poignantly conveyed by the alternating voices of Jerry and TimO'Brien - and here's where Tim's voice is recognizeable.  I won't spoilit by telling you how the song ends - you have to get the album to findout.<P>I believe this is the most exciting bluegrass album to come out aquite a while, and I say that realizing it puts a number of very finealbums in second place.  If the few weeks of experience are any indication,it only takes hearing one or two cuts to convince bluegrass fans andnon-bluegrassers alike to obtain their own copy for extended listening.The album does tend to reach out and get you hooked.  This is not the firstrecording Jerry Wicentowski has made.  The Bluegrass Hoppers (mentionedabove) had a nationally distributed album in the late 60's.  Jerry's vocalperformances on that long out-of-print vinyl are surprisingly similar inquality to his new offering.<P>This would be an outstanding album even if Jerry were a top nationallyknown full time touring act.  For a local part time performer to come upwith a project of this outstanding quality is truly remarkable.  I predictgreat success for this album, including a second pressing very soon.Jerry, I hope you're already working on a follow-up album; you'redefinitely gonna need one.  My only reservation is "what can you possiblydo to top this first effort."<P><HR><H4><A HREF="index.html">Return to Lucky Break Main Page</A></H4></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
